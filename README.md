Twitter API Keys:
The first necessary step is to have a Twitter account and get the necessary credentials on the Twitter developer platform to access the Twitter API.
By registration on https://developer.twitter.com/ I have got the four necessary authentication codes.

Then create an Auther Client connection.

From twitter API url can be obtained:
https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json

Remove retweets from the extraction results and filter all replies to tweets, which are often unnecessary for analysis.

None of tweets to be retrieved per one call and parameters according to twitter API.

We retrieve tweets in the number of 100 since it is the maximum amount for one-time search.

In the document there are some examples I tried.
